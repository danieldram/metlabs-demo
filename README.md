Welcome to the MetaLab front-end hiring test! 

Below are three files you will need to complete the project. Please read the **Assignment** and **Submission** sections thoroughly!

- [Assignment](./docs/assignment.md)
- [Submission](./docs/submission.md)
- [API Docs](./docs/api.md)

If you ever get stuck on something, or want to explain your thoughts, you can jot your thoughts down in [notes.md](./notes.md). Serious **bonus points** if you explain why/how you did stuff!

## Run the project
The project is built using node `10.4.1` and npm `6.1.0`.

```
npm install
npm run dev

// Your browser should automatically open,
// but if it doesn't, visit localhost:8080
```
