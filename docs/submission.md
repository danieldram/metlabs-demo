# Submission Process
Your submission should contain a git commit history.

When you first start the project make sure you `$ git init`, to create a bare git repo. As you are working on the project, commit your changes however you like - but keep in mind we will be looking at your commit history for a clean, descriptive log of your changes. Feel free to rebase if you would like to cleanup your history.

Once you're done zip up your whole project directory, then send it back to us!
